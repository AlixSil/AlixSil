ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone, I'm Alix Silvert. Classicaly trained as a bioinformatician and interested in data in general.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in the Berlin or Paris area ! I would like to take this opportunity to make the jump to data science or a more informatic based post !

## Bioinformatic ðŸŒ¿

Most of my professional work is done with labs that like to keep their cards close to the chest, but here's one I'm currently working on a pipeline for the analysis of sn-cell for a lab.

## Data Science ðŸ“ˆ
- _Analysis and prediction of early diabetes_ : In this, I take two different approach, the first one aiming at a human doable and quick classification for patients, and in a second part, I compare the accuracy obtainable by Random Forest, XGBoost and LDE. https://github.com/AlixSil/diabetes_prediction
