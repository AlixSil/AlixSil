👋 Hello Everyone, I'm Alix Silvert. Classicaly trained as a bioinformatician and interested in data in general.

👀 I’m currently looking for a job in the Berlin or Paris area ! I would like to take this opportunity to make the jump to data science or a more informatic based post !

## Bioinformatic 🌿
Most of my professional work is done with labs that like to keep their cards close to the chest, but here's one I'm currently working on a pipeline for the analysis of sn-cell for a lab.

## Data Science 📈
- [_Analysis and prediction of early diabetes_](https://github.com/AlixSil/diabetes_prediction) : In this, I take two different approach, the first one aiming at a human doable and quick classification for patients, and in a second part, I compare the accuracy obtainable by Random Forest, XGBoost and LDE.
 
## Data Scrapping 🗃️
- [_Scrapping of theses.fr_](https://github.com/AlixSil/scrapping_thesefr) : Scrapping of the website theses.fr, which contains data on most thesis defended in France. The scrapping is made via the use of BeautifulSoup and uses snakemake as a way to cut the scrapping into several chunks to avoid having to relaunch the whole analysis in case of error. This is still WIP, but functional.
