ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone, I'm Alix Silvert. Classicaly trained as a bioinformatician and interested in data in general.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in the Berlin or Paris area ! I would like to take this opportunity to make the jump to data science or a more informatic based post !

## Bioinformatic ðŸŒ¿
Most of my professional work is done with labs that like to keep their cards close to the chest, but here's one I'm currently working on a pipeline for the analysis of sn-cell for a lab.

## Data Science ðŸ“ˆ
- [_Analysis and prediction of early diabetes_](https://github.com/AlixSil/diabetes_prediction) : In this, I take two different approach, the first one aiming at a human doable and quick classification for patients, and in a second part, I compare the accuracy obtainable by Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and LDE.
- [ Analysis of the effects of normalisation of RNA on survival prediction ](https://github.com/AlixSil/sklearn-rna) : For this project, I am creating a library that allow RNA normalisation with the fit/transform paradigm of data science. I am also investigating the impact of normalisation on survival prediction. Not only by comparing the efficiency of several normalisation methods, but also by checking wether normalising test and train data together (as it is often done) lead to a data leakage strong enough to inflate the prediction quality.
